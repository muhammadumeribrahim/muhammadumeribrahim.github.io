# My Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my work and experience as an IT professional and web developer.

## About This Project

I built this website to present my professional background, skills, and projects in a clean and modern way. The site highlights my experience from IT support to web development, including my recent internship and capstone project work.

## What I Used

- HTML5 and CSS3 for the structure and styling
- JavaScript for interactive features and animations
- Responsive design so it works on phones, tablets, and desktops
- Custom CSS animations to make it more engaging

## File Structure

```
├── index.html          # Main page
├── css/
│   ├── styles.css      # Main styles
│   └── animations.css  # Animation styles
├── js/
│   ├── main.js        # Main functionality
│   └── animations.js  # Animation controls
└── README.md          # This file
```

## How I Built It

I wanted to create something that looked professional but also showed my technical skills. The design uses a modern color scheme with smooth animations that activate as you scroll. I made sure it works well on mobile devices since most people browse on their phones.

The JavaScript handles the smooth scrolling navigation and the scroll-triggered animations. I separated the CSS and JS into different files to keep things organized and make it easier to maintain.

## Running the Site
